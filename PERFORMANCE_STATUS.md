## What's Actually Working ✅

### 0. Clause-Based Planner + QueryExecutor (ACTIVE - ARCHITECTURAL WIN)
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready and default architecture
**Performance**: **2× faster on complex queries** (verified Oct 2025)
**Location**: `datalog/planner/planner_clause_based.go`, `datalog/executor/query_executor.go`

**Measured Results**:
- Full architecture comparison (OHLC queries): ~4-8s (old) → ~2-4s (new) = **2× faster** ✅
- Plan quality isolated (same executor): Both planners perform identically within measurement noise
- Planning overhead: 3-12µs (old) → 1-7µs (new) = 37-88% faster (but negligible impact)

**Key Difference**: The 2× speedup comes from QueryExecutor's clause-by-clause streaming execution, not from better plan quality. Both planners produce equivalent-quality plans.

**Configuration**: Enabled by default
```go
exec := executor.NewExecutorWithOptions(matcher, planner.PlannerOptions{
    UseClauseBasedPlanner: true,  // Default
})
exec.SetUseQueryExecutor(true)    // Use QueryExecutor
```

**Details**: See `docs/reference/PLANNER_COMPARISON.md`

### 1. Query Plan Caching (ACTIVE)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and enabled by default
**Location**: `datalog/planner/cache.go`, `datalog/storage/database.go:34`
**Performance**: ~3× speedup for repeated queries (measured)

### 2. Batch Scanning with Iterator Reuse (ACTIVE)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented, used for large binding sets
**Location**: `datalog/storage/matcher_relations.go:122-128`
**Threshold**: Activated when `bindingRel.Size() > 100`
**Result**: Code clarity improvement, minimal performance impact

### 3. Predicate Classification (ACTIVE)
**Status**: ✅ Infrastructure in place, used by executor
**Location**: `datalog/executor/predicate_classifier.go`
**What it does**: Classifies predicates as pushable vs. non-pushable

### 4. Join Condition Detection (ACTIVE)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and used
**Location**: `datalog/executor/join_conditions.go`
**What it does**: Detects equality predicates that can be pushed into joins

### 5. Progressive Join Execution (CRITICAL & ACTIVE)
**Status**: ✅ Core safeguard preventing memory explosion
**Location**: `datalog/executor/relation.go`
**Why it matters**: Greedy join ordering + early termination prevents catastrophic intermediate result sizes
**Scale achieved**: Production-ready for datasets from 100K to 10M+ datoms, tested up to 500M+

---

## Recent Optimizations (October 2025) ✅

### 0. Single-Use Iterator Semantics & Streaming (COMPLETE - CORRECTNESS FIX)
**Status**: ✅ Proper iterator lifecycle management with single-use semantics
**Performance**: **4.06× speedup for iterator composition**, **2.22× for streaming** (verified 2025-10-25)
**Commits**: 626e409 (latest), 4a394cb, 4f3b742, 15d196d, 78c930a

**What We Fixed** (2025-10-25):
- ✅ **Single-use iterator semantics** - StreamingRelation enforces one-time iteration
- ✅ **BufferedIterator** - Safe re-iteration support with automatic caching
- ✅ **Iterator lifecycle** - Clear separation between first use (streaming) and re-use (cached)
- ✅ **Correctness** - All tests pass with proper semantics enforcement

**What We Built Earlier** (Oct 2025):
- ✅ **Iterator composition** - Filter/Project/Transform operations stay lazy
- ✅ **Options propagation** - ExecutorOptions flow through entire pipeline
- ✅ **BadgerMatcher streaming** - Returns StreamingRelation instead of materializing
- ✅ **Symmetric hash join** - Streaming-to-streaming joins without materialization

**Current Performance Results** (verified 2025-10-25):

**Iterator Composition Benchmark**:
- Materialized: 1,259 μs, 3.27 MB, 25K allocs
- Composed: 310 μs, 360 KB, 15K allocs
- **Result: 4.06× faster, 89% memory reduction** ✅

**Streaming Scenarios** (10K tuples):
- Large_HighSelectivity (1% pass): 1.07× faster (675μs → 630μs), 2% memory reduction
- Large_MediumSelectivity (10% pass): 1.44× faster (975μs → 676μs), 19% memory reduction
- Large_LowSelectivity (50% pass): **2.22× faster** (1,720μs → 774μs), **52% memory reduction**
- **Key Finding**: Benefits scale with filter selectivity (1.07× to 2.22× depending on selectivity)

**Configuration**: Enabled by default:
```go
EnableIteratorComposition: true  // Lazy evaluation (default)
EnableTrueStreaming: true        // No auto-materialization (default)
```

### 1. In-Memory Indexing (COMPLETE - PERVASIVE OPTIMIZATION)
**Status**: ✅ IndexedMemoryMatcher with hash indices
**Performance**: Hash indices now used throughout (test suite 7s, down from timeouts)
**Commit**: Latest

**What Works**:
- ✅ Hash indices for E/A/V lookups (entityIndex, attributeIndex, valueIndex, eavIndex)
- ✅ Thread-safe lazy initialization with sync.Once
- ✅ Smart index selection (EA > E > A > V > linear)
- ✅ Two-phase value lookup (hash → exact match) for interface{} types

**Historical Note**:
During development, benchmarks showed dramatic speedups (49-4802×) comparing linear scan vs indexed lookups. However, subsequent refactoring made hash indices the default path for both IndexedMemoryMatcher and MemoryPatternMatcher. Current benchmarks show identical performance because both implementations now use the optimized path.

**Impact**: Entity lookups are O(1) instead of O(N). Test suite execution time dramatically reduced. This is a **success story** - the optimization became so pervasive that there's no longer a "slow path" to compare against.

**Details**: See `IN_MEMORY_INDEX_RESULTS.md` (historical benchmarks)

### 2. Time Range Optimization (COMPLETE)
**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with storage integration
**Performance**: **4× speedup on large datasets** (41s → 10.2s on 260-hour dataset, commit dc2ad4e)
**Note**: Small datasets show minimal benefit (3.5% on 10-day dataset)
**Commits**: Latest in dc2ad4e

**What Works**:
- ✅ Time range extraction from correlation keys (10µs for 260 ranges)
- ✅ Multi-range AVET scanning in BadgerDB (260 time ranges)
- ✅ Metadata propagation (negligible 20ns overhead)
- ✅ Size check optimization (<50 tuples skip extraction)

**Benchmark Results** (BenchmarkOHLCQuery, verified 2025-10-24):
- Small dataset (10 days, 390 bars/day):
  - WithoutPushdown: 48.8ms
  - WithPushdown: 33.3ms
  - WithTimeRangeOpt: 32.1ms (**3.5% improvement**, 1.52× vs no optimization)
- Large dataset (260 hours): **4× speedup** (41s → 10.2s, measured during development)

**Key Insight**: Time-range optimization benefit scales with dataset size and time selectivity. Most valuable for large historical datasets with selective time filters.

**Details**: See `TIME_RANGE_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md`

### 3. Hash Join Pre-Sizing (COMPLETE)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented across all join operations
**Performance**: 24-32% faster, 24-30% less memory for hash operations
**Commit**: dc2ad4e

**What Was Done**:
- ✅ Added `NewTupleKeyMapWithCapacity()` for pre-sizing
- ✅ Updated 7 call sites (HashJoin, SemiJoin, AntiJoin, deduplication)
- ✅ Pre-size based on relation sizes to avoid map growth

**Impact**:
- Micro-level: 24-32% faster TupleKeyMap operations
- Macro-level: Minimal impact on OHLC (pattern matching dominates)
- High impact for large joins (>1,000 tuples)

**Details**: See `HASH_JOIN_PRESIZING_SUMMARY.md`

### 4. Semantic Rewriting with Expression Elimination (COMPLETE)
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready with predicate transformation
**Performance**: 2.6-5.8× speedup on time-filtered queries
**Commits**: Multiple in Oct 2025

**What Works**:
- ✅ Time extraction → range constraint transformation
- ✅ Expression/predicate elimination (skip optimized-away code)
- ✅ Multi-component constraint composition (year+month+day+hour)
- ✅ MemoryPatternMatcher integration

**Benchmarks**:
- Year filter (33% selective): 2.6× faster
- Day filter (12.5% selective): 4.1× faster
- Hour filter (1.4% selective): 5.8× faster

**Note**: With decorrelation enabled, semantic rewriting shows no additional speedup (1.00×) because both optimize the same bottleneck (time extraction overhead). Decorrelation eliminates 97% of evaluations, leaving nothing for semantic rewriting to optimize. Still valuable for standalone queries (1.64× speedup) and future BadgerDB integration.

**Recommended**: `EnableSemanticRewriting: true`
**Details**: See `docs/archive/2025-10/SEMANTIC_REWRITING_FINDINGS.md`

### 5. Common Subexpression Elimination - CSE (COMPLETE, DISABLED BY DEFAULT)
**Status**: ✅ Correctly implemented, minimal benefit with parallelization
**Performance**: 1-3% improvement sequential, -1% with parallel

**What Was Done**:
- ✅ Merges filter groups with identical structure
- ✅ Reduces multiple queries → single merged query
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (correctness + performance)

**Why Disabled**:
- Parallel execution already runs filter groups concurrently
- Merging removes parallelism opportunity
- 1% improvement too small to justify enabled by default

**When to Enable**: Single-threaded environments, expensive predicates
**Recommended**: `EnableCSE: false`
**Details**: See `docs/archive/2025-10/CSE_FINDINGS.md`

### 6. Parallel Subquery Execution (COMPLETE)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and enabled by default
**Performance**: **2.06× speedup** with 8 workers (verified 2025-10-25)
**Commits**: 626e409 (with single-use semantics), d645cfd, ec45d77, 2439e0a

**What Works**:
- ✅ Worker pool with bounded parallelism (uses runtime.NumCPU())
- ✅ Query plan reuse across iterations
- ✅ Thread-safe result aggregation
- ✅ Proper iterator lifecycle management

**Benchmark Results** (BenchmarkRelationInputParallel, 2400 input tuples):
- Sequential: 730 ms, 1,101 MB/op
- Parallel-2Workers: 738 ms (1.01× slower, overhead for small dataset)
- Parallel-4Workers: 534 ms (1.37× faster)
- **Parallel-8Workers: 355 ms (2.06× faster)** ✅
- Parallel-16Workers: 436 ms (1.67× faster, diminishing returns)
- Parallel-32Workers: 418 ms (1.75× faster, overhead exceeds benefit)

**Key Finding**: Optimal worker count is 8 on M3 Max. Memory usage remains constant across all configurations (~1.1 GB), demonstrating proper lifecycle management and no memory leaks.

### 7. Intern Cache Optimization (COMPLETE)
**Status**: ✅ Lock-free sync.Map replacing sync.RWMutex
**Performance**: 6.26× speedup for BadgerDB parallel queries
**Commit**: e3c956b

**Impact**:
- Before: 35% CPU time on mutex contention
- After: Near-zero lock contention with atomic operations
- Micro-benchmarks: 13-80× faster intern operations

### 8. OHLC Query Performance (MEASURED 2025-10-25)
**Benchmark**: OHLC queries with subqueries and predicate pushdown

**Subquery Performance** (BenchmarkOHLCSubqueries):
- Single aggregation: 17.3 ms/op, 66.7 MB/op, 934K allocs
- Three aggregations: 51.3 ms/op, 199.6 MB/op, 2.8M allocs
- **Result**: Linear scaling (3× subqueries = 2.96× time, 3× memory), proper semantics ✅

**Predicate Pushdown - Small Dataset** (BenchmarkOHLCQuery, 10 days × 3 symbols × 390 bars):
- Without pushdown: 33.6 ms/op, 39.4 MB/op, 534K allocs
- With pushdown: 21.3 ms/op, 20.0 MB/op, 330K allocs
- With time-range opt: 21.5 ms/op, 20.0 MB/op, 330K allocs
- **Result: 1.58× faster, 49% memory reduction, 38% fewer allocations** ✅

**Predicate Pushdown - Large Dataset** (BenchmarkOHLCQueryLargeDataset, 90 days × 50 symbols sparse):
- Without pushdown: 1,043 ms/op, 3,484 MB/op, 15.4M allocs
- With pushdown: 375 ms/op, 296 MB/op, 5.2M allocs
- **Result: 2.78× faster, 91.5% memory reduction, 66.2% fewer allocations** ✅
- **Key insight**: Predicate pushdown scales better with larger datasets (1.58× → 2.78×)

**Key Findings**:
- Iterator semantics correctly enforced (no re-iteration bugs)
- Memory scales linearly with query complexity (predictable)
- Predicate pushdown benefits increase with dataset size
- Large dataset queries complete in <400ms even with 90 days of data

## Profiling Results (October 2025)

### In-Memory Execution Path
**Profiled**: MemoryPatternMatcher with OHLC queries

**CPU Bottlenecks** (measured via pprof):
- Pattern matching: 58% (matchesDatomWithPattern, matchesConstant, matchesElement)
- Memory copying: 18% (runtime.duffcopy)
- Hash operations: Various small percentages

**Memory Allocations** (measured via pprof):
- TupleKeyMap operations: 35% (now optimized with pre-sizing)
- Expression evaluation: 9-19% (time extractions)
- Pattern matching: 14%

**Key Finding**: Pattern matching dominates CPU time in-memory queries. Optimizations targeting pattern matching (in-memory indexing) made hash indices the default path throughout the codebase.

### Storage-Backed Execution Path
**Profiled**: BadgerMatcher with OHLC queries
**Query Time**: 56ms for 260 hours (measured)

**Key Finding**: Storage-backed queries already fast enough for production use. Focus has been on correctness and architectural improvements rather than micro-optimizations.

**Details**: See `PROFILING_SUMMARY.md` and `EXECUTION_CHAIN_PROFILING_ANALYSIS.md`

## Performance Test Results (Actual Benchmarks)

### Planner/Executor Architecture (2025-10-22)
**Benchmark Suite**: `BenchmarkPlannerOnly`, `BenchmarkPlanQuality`, `BenchmarkFullQueryOldVsNewPlanner`

**Planning Overhead Only** (BenchmarkPlannerOnly):
| Query Type | Old Planner | New Planner | Speedup |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Simple pattern | 3,940 ns | 2,048 ns | 52% faster |
| Single subquery | 4,382 ns | 758 ns | 83% faster |
| OHLC query | 11,546 ns | 1,673 ns | 86% faster |

**Key Finding**: Planning is fast (1-15 microseconds) regardless of planner. Planning speed has negligible impact on total query time.

**Plan Quality** (BenchmarkPlanQuality - both using QueryExecutor, verified 2025-10-24):
| Query Type | Old Planner | New Planner | Difference |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| simple_join | 1.609 ms | 1.612 ms | 0.2% slower (within noise) |
| aggregation | 2.003 ms | 2.014 ms | 0.6% slower (within noise) |
| multi_join | 2.882 ms | 2.886 ms | 0.1% slower (within noise) |

**Key Finding**: When isolated (same executor), both planners produce equivalent-quality plans. Performance differences are within measurement noise.

**Full Architecture** (BenchmarkFullQueryOldVsNewPlanner - old planner+executor vs new planner+executor):
| Query Type | Old Architecture | New Architecture | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| OHLC queries | ~4-8 seconds | ~2-4 seconds | **~2× faster** |

**Key Finding**: The 2× improvement comes from QueryExecutor's clause-by-clause streaming execution model, not from planner differences. Both planners produce equivalent-quality plans when using the same executor.

**Details**: See `docs/reference/PLANNER_COMPARISON.md`

### Time Range Optimization (2025-10-08)
**Hourly OHLC (260 hours)**:
- Before: 41s
- After: 10.2s
- **Speedup: 4.0×** ✅

**Daily OHLC (22 days)**:
- Before: 217ms

| 100 | 6.9µs → 5.2µs | 17KB → 13KB | 25% faster |
| 1,000 | 105µs → 71µs | 259KB → 181KB | 32% faster |
| 10,000 | 1.34ms → 1.24ms | 2.3MB → 1.7MB | 7% faster |

### Semantic Rewriting (2025-10-07)
| Filter Type | Selectivity | Speedup |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Year only | 33% | 2.6× |
| Year+Month+Day | 12.5% | 4.1× |
| Year+Month+Day+Hour | 1.4% | 5.8× |

### Plan Cache (Empirical)
- First query: ~1-5ms planning time
- Cached query: ~0.3ms planning time
- **~3× speedup for repeated queries**

---

## Optimization Priorities

### High Impact, Already Done ✅
All items below are **measured** and **active** in production code:

1. ✅ **New architecture** (clause-based planner + QueryExecutor) - **2× faster on complex queries** (verified 2025-10-24)
2. ✅ **Iterator composition** - **4.06× faster, 89% memory reduction** (verified 2025-10-25)
3. ✅ **Parallel subquery execution** - **2.06× speedup with 8 workers** (verified 2025-10-25)
4. ✅ **Intern cache optimization** - **6.26× speedup with BadgerDB**
5. ✅ **Query plan caching** - **3× speedup for repeated queries**
6. ✅ **Time range optimization** - **4× speedup on hourly OHLC**
7. ✅ **Semantic rewriting** - **2-6× on time-filtered queries**
8. ✅ **Predicate pushdown** - **1.58-2.78× faster** (scales with dataset size), **up to 91.5% memory reduction** (verified 2025-10-25)
9. ✅ **Streaming execution** - **2.22× on low-selectivity filters, 52% memory reduction** (verified 2025-10-25)
10. ✅ **Hash join pre-sizing** - **24-32% faster, 24-30% less memory**
11. ✅ **In-memory indexing** - Hash indices now default path throughout codebase
12. ✅ **Relation collapsing algorithm** - **Prevents catastrophic Cartesian products**

### Potential Future Work 🎯
These are **ideas**, not commitments. Would require benchmarking before implementation:

1. Streaming aggregations - Reduce memory for large groups
2. BadgerDB time range integration - Push time constraints to storage layer
3. Composite index support - For multi-attribute filters

### Rejected After Benchmarking ❌
These were **tried and measured** - data showed they're not worth the complexity:

1. ~~Key mask iterator for int64~~ - Benchmarked slower than simple approach
2. ~~Complex iterator reuse~~ - Simpler code is faster
3. ~~Aggressive CSE~~ - 1-3% sequential, -1% parallel (disabled by default)

---

## Recommended Configuration (October 2025)

**Production Configuration** (all settings are measured and proven):

```go
// Use new architecture (2× faster on complex queries)
exec := executor.NewExecutorWithOptions(matcher, planner.PlannerOptions{
    UseClauseBasedPlanner: true,  // ✅ DEFAULT - works with QueryExecutor
})
exec.SetUseQueryExecutor(true)    // ✅ Use QueryExecutor (DEFAULT - clause-by-clause streaming)

// Recommended planner options
PlannerOptions{
    UseClauseBasedPlanner:        true,  // ✅ DEFAULT - required for QueryExecutor
    EnablePredicatePushdown:      true,  // ✅ DEFAULT - early filtering
    EnableSemanticRewriting:      true,  // ✅ 2-6× on time queries
    EnableSubqueryDecorrelation:  true,  // ✅ Batch identical subqueries
    EnableParallelDecorrelation:  true,  // ✅ 6.9× speedup in-memory
    EnableCSE:                    false, // ❌ 1-3% benefit, disabled by default
}

// Recommended executor options
ExecutorOptions{
    EnableIteratorComposition:    true,  // ✅ DEFAULT - lazy evaluation (4.2× speedup)
    EnableTrueStreaming:          true,  // ✅ DEFAULT - streaming (1.9× on low-selectivity)
    EnableSubqueryDecorrelation:  true,  // ✅ Batch identical subqueries
}
```

**Key Changes from Previous Versions**:
- New clause-based planner is now default (was experimental)
- QueryExecutor is now default (was opt-in)
- Streaming execution always enabled (was toggle)
- All settings backed by measured benchmarks

## Performance Philosophy

### What We Got Right
1. **Correctness first** - Semantics before speed
2. **Measure everything** - Benchmarks revealed truth
3. **Simple code wins** - Iterator reuse complexity didn't pay off
4. **Smart algorithms** - Relation collapsing is the real hero
5. **Targeted optimization** - Profile, optimize bottlenecks, verify

### What We Learned
1. **Micro-optimizations fail** - Opens are 3µs, not worth complexity
2. **Architecture matters** - Can't push predicates without storage support
3. **Premature optimization is real** - Key mask, iterator reuse both slower
4. **Document reality** - Aspirational docs cause confusion
5. **Redundant optimizations exist** - Semantic rewriting + decorrelation target same bottleneck

### What's Next
1. Keep **simple, correct code** (complexity doesn't pay)
2. Let **algorithms win** (relation collapsing, not tricks)
3. Build **only what benchmarks prove** (no more speculation)
4. Consider **streaming aggregations** for memory efficiency

---

## The Bottom Line

**What Actually Matters**:
1. ✅ Relation collapsing prevents memory explosion (CRITICAL)
2. ✅ Query plan caching speeds up repeated queries (3× improvement)
3. ✅ Parallel execution eliminates bottlenecks (6.26× speedup)
4. ✅ Time range optimization targets specific queries (4× speedup)
5. ✅ Semantic rewriting optimizes time queries (2-6× speedup)
6. ✅ Code correctness and simplicity beat micro-optimizations

**What Doesn't Matter**:
1. ❌ Iterator open/close overhead (3µs, negligible)
2. ❌ Key mask filtering for simple types (overhead > benefit)
3. ❌ Complex reuse strategies (simpler code performs better)
4. ❌ CSE with parallel execution (removes parallelism opportunity)

The engine is **production-ready for datasets up to 10M+ datoms**. All major optimizations are complete and working well. Performance is excellent for typical workloads (100K-1M datoms), with targeted optimizations for specific patterns (time queries, large joins). Large config testing demonstrates scalability to 500M+ datoms.

  - Predicate pushdown (large dataset): **2.78×** (1,043ms → 375ms), 91.5% memory reduction
- Fixed BenchmarkOHLCQueryLargeDataset transaction size bug (commit per-symbol-per-day)
- Key lesson: **Clean benchmarks reveal precise truth, and predicate pushdown scales better with larger datasets**

### 2025-10-08: Profiling, Hash Join & In-Memory Indexing
- Profiled entire OHLC execution chain (in-memory + storage)
- Identified hash join as 35% of allocations
- Implemented map pre-sizing: 24-32% faster, 24-30% less memory
- Confirmed time range optimization too fast to profile (10µs)
- Identified pattern matching as 58% CPU in-memory → implemented hash indices
- **Massive win**: Entity lookups 49-4802× faster, test suite now 7s (down from timeouts)

### 2025-10-07: Time Range Optimization
- Implemented semi-join pushdown via time range constraints
- Achieved 4× speedup on hourly OHLC (41s → 10.2s)
- Fixed daily OHLC regression with size check
- Optimized extractTimeRanges: 4.7× faster, 108× fewer allocations

### 2025-10-04: Parallel Execution & Intern Optimization
- Identified intern cache as 35% CPU bottleneck
- Replaced sync.RWMutex with sync.Map → 6.26× BadgerDB speedup
- Fixed index selection to use AEVT when E+A both bound
- Performance gains: In-memory 6.9×, BadgerDB 1.63× → 6.26×
