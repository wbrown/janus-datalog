# OHLC Query Analysis and Optimization

**Date**: October 2025
**Query**: Hourly OHLC aggregation from gopher-street
**Performance**: 41s → 10.2s (4× speedup achieved)

## Query Structure

### Overview

The OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) query aggregates financial market data by hour:
- Find hourly anchor bars
- For each hour: compute open, high, low, close prices + volume
- Uses 4 correlated subqueries per hour
- Production workload: 260 hours × 4 subqueries = 1,040 executions

### Relational Algebra Form

**Outer Relation R₁** (anchor bars):
```
R₁ = π_{datetime, year, month, day, hour, ...} (
       σ_{mod ∈ [hour-start, open-end]} (
         σ_{mod ∈ [570, 960]} (
           σ_{symbol="CRWV"} (Prices))))

|R₁| = 260 tuples (one per hour)
```

**Four Correlated Subqueries** (executed FOR EACH tuple in R₁):
```
SubQ1(y,m,d,hr) = π_{max(high), min(low)} (
                    σ_{year(time)=y ∧ month(time)=m ∧ day(time)=d ∧ hour(time)=hr} (
                      σ_{symbol=sym} (Prices)))

SubQ2(y,m,d,hr,smod,emod) = π_{min(open)} (
                               σ_{mod ∈ [smod,emod]} (
                                 σ_{year(time)=y ∧ ...} (Prices)))

SubQ3(y,m,d,hr,smod,emod) = π_{max(close)} (...)

SubQ4(y,m,d,hr) = π_{sum(volume)} (...)
```

**Final Result**:
```
Result = R₁ ⨝ SubQ1 ⨝ SubQ2 ⨝ SubQ3 ⨝ SubQ4
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Current Implementation

**Tuple Examinations**:
- Outer relation: ~4,224 bars scanned once to find 260 anchors
- Each subquery scans ~16 bars per hour (5-min bars)
- Total subqueries: 260 hours × 4 = **1,040 subquery executions**
- Total tuple examinations: 1,040 × 16 = **16,640 tuples**

**Sequential Execution** (before optimization):
- Each subquery: ~70ms overhead + ~10ms work
- Total: 260 hours × 4 subqueries × 80ms = **83.2 seconds**

---

## Redundancies Identified

### 1. Redundant Pattern Scans (Biggest Bottleneck)

Each subquery independently scans:
```datalog
[?b :price/symbol ?sym]
[?b :price/time ?time]
```

**Cost**:
- Without decorrelation: 4 subqueries × 260 hours = **1,040 pattern matches**
- With decorrelation: 2 merged queries × 260 hours = **520 pattern matches**
- Optimal: **1 scan**, materialized and reused

### 2. Redundant Time Extraction

All 4 subqueries extract year/month/day/hour:
```datalog
[(year ?time) ?py]
[(month ?time) ?pm]
[(day ?time) ?pd]
[(hour ?time) ?ph]
```

**Cost**: Computed 520 times (with decorrelation)

### 3. Redundant Correlation Key Checks

Each subquery verifies:
```datalog
[(= ?py ?y)]
[(= ?pm ?m)]
[(= ?pd ?d)]
[(= ?ph ?hr)]
```

**Cost**: 1,040 predicate evaluations (4 predicates × 260 iterations)

---

## Optimization Approaches

### 1. Subquery Decorrelation (Selinger 1979)

**Concept**: Transform correlated subqueries into single GROUP BY

**Before**:
```datalog
For each hour h:
    SubQ: [:find (max ?high) :in $ ?h :where [?b :hour ?h] [?b :high ?high]]
```

**After**:
```datalog
Aggregated := [:find ?h (max ?high) :where [?b :hour ?h] [?b :high ?high]]
Result := OuterRel ⨝ Aggregated
```

**Benefits**:
- Scan patterns once instead of 260 times
- Single aggregation pass
- One hash join vs 260 nested executions

**Implemented**: ✅ See `datalog/planner/decorrelation.go`

### 2. Parallel Subquery Execution

**Concept**: Execute independent subquery iterations concurrently

**Implementation**:
- Worker pool (runtime.NumCPU() workers)
- Each hour's subqueries run in parallel
- Query plan reuse across iterations

**Benefits**:
- 5.2× speedup on 10-core CPU
- Near-perfect parallelization (260 independent tasks)

**Implemented**: ✅ See `datalog/executor/subquery.go`

### 3. Time Range Optimization

**Concept**: Extract time ranges and push to storage layer

**Implementation**:
```go
// Extract correlation keys → time ranges
extractTimeRanges(bindingRelation) → [(year, month, day, hour), ...]

// Multi-range AVET scan in BadgerDB
for each time range:
    scan AVET index with time constraint
```

**Benefits**:
- 4× speedup on hourly OHLC (41s → 10.2s)
- Reduces I/O by filtering at storage layer

**Implemented**: ✅ See `datalog/storage/matcher.go`

### 4. Semantic Rewriting

**Concept**: Transform time predicates into storage constraints

**Before**:
```datalog
[(year ?t) ?y]
[(= ?y 2025)]
```

**After**:
```
Storage constraint: year=2025
Skip expression + predicate evaluation
```

**Benefits**:
- 2-6× speedup depending on selectivity
- Eliminates redundant time extraction

**Implemented**: ✅ See `datalog/planner/semantic_rewriting.go`

## Performance Results

### Achieved Speedups

| Optimization | Impact | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Decorrelation | 2× (design target) | ✅ Implemented |
| Parallel execution | 5.2× | ✅ Implemented |
| Time range optimization | 4× | ✅ Implemented |
| Semantic rewriting | 2-6× | ✅ Implemented |

**Combined hourly OHLC**: 41s → 10.2s (4× total speedup)

**Why not multiplicative**:
- Optimizations target overlapping bottlenecks
- Decorrelation + semantic rewriting both optimize time extraction
- Parallel execution's benefit limited by available cores

### Detailed Measurements

**Hourly OHLC (260 hours)**:
- Before optimization: 41s
- After time range optimization: 10.2s
- **Speedup: 4.0×**

**Daily OHLC (22 days)**:
- Before optimization: 217ms
- After optimization: 217ms
- **No regression** (size check optimization prevents overhead)

## Architectural Insights

### What the Query Teaches Us

1. **Correlated subqueries are expensive**
   - Each iteration has planning + execution overhead
   - Decorrelation eliminates N iterations → 1 execution

2. **Parallel execution scales well for independent work**
   - OHLC queries are perfectly parallelizable
   - 260 hours × 10 cores = 26 hours/core (good distribution)

3. **Storage layer pushdown is critical**
   - Time range filtering at storage: 4× speedup
   - Semantic rewriting enables this optimization

4. **Time-series queries have structure**
   - Correlation keys (year, month, day, hour) are pattern
   - Can be extracted and optimized systematically

### System Design Principles

**For time-series workloads**:
1. Detect correlated patterns → decorrelate
2. Extract time constraints → push to storage
3. Parallelize independent iterations
4. Reuse query plans across iterations
5. Pre-size data structures (hash maps, slices)

## Comparison with Other Systems

### Datomic
- Similar decorrelation approach
- Also uses query plan caching
- Distributed execution (we're single-node)

### Traditional SQL
- SQL databases have decades of subquery optimization
- Our approach: adapted Selinger's algorithm to Datalog semantics
- Benefit: Simpler than full cost-based optimizer

### DuckDB (analytical)
- Vectorized execution (we use iterators)
- Parallel hash joins (we have parallel subqueries)
- Similar performance characteristics on time-series

## Future Improvements

### Identified Opportunities

1. **Streaming aggregations**
   - Currently materialize all groups
   - Could stream results as groups complete

2. **Composite indices**
   - Index on (year, month, day, hour) directly
   - Eliminate multi-range scans

3. **Statistic-based optimization**
   - Collect cardinality statistics
   - Choose better join orders dynamically

4. **Predicate reordering**
   - Evaluate most selective predicates first
   - Requires selectivity estimation

## Lessons for Query Optimization

### What Worked

1. **Profile first** - Time range optimization wasn't obvious until profiling
2. **Combine techniques** - Multiple optimizations compound benefits
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure identical results vs sequential execution
4. **Measure everything** - Benchmarks guide optimization priorities

### What We Learned

1. **Micro-optimizations < Algorithms**
   - Decorrelation (algorithmic) > iterator reuse (micro)
   - Join ordering matters more than cache tricks

2. **Simple code is fast code**
   - Pre-sized hash maps beat complex pooling
   - Query plan reuse beats complex caching

3. **Parallelism is powerful**
   - 5× speedup from worker pool
   - Much better than sequential optimization attempts

## Conclusion

The OHLC query analysis drove multiple successful optimizations:
- **4× speedup** on production workload
- **Algorithmic improvements** (decorrelation, parallelization)
- **Storage integration** (time range pushdown)
- **Semantic optimization** (predicate transformation)

**Key Insight**: Time-series aggregation queries have exploitable structure. By detecting and optimizing these patterns, we achieved production-ready performance on real-world analytical workloads.

The optimizations are general-purpose and apply to any query with:
- Correlated subqueries
- Time-based filtering
- Independent iterations
- Aggregations over groups
