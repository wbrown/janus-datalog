# Parallel Execution Status

## What We Have:

**Parallel RelationInput Execution** (executor.go:723-760)
- Uses worker pool with goroutines
- For subqueries with `:in $ [[?x ?y] ...]` (tuple/relation inputs)
- NOT used by OHLC query

**✅ Parallel Decorrelated Query Execution** (subquery_decorrelation.go:46-82)
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Merged queries now execute in PARALLEL using goroutines
- Executes filter groups concurrently using sync.WaitGroup
- Each merged query runs in its own goroutine
- Tested and verified correct results
- Performance improvements:
  - OHLC query: 1.78x speedup (TestDecorrelationOHLCScale)
  - Category aggregation: 1.21x speedup (TestDecorrelationActuallyWorks)

## What We DON'T Have:

**Parallel ScalarInput Execution** (subquery.go:39-56)
- OHLC query uses `:in $ ?sym ?year ?month ?day ?hour` (scalar inputs)
- Current code is SEQUENTIAL:
```go
for _, inputValues := range inputCombinations {
    result, err := executePhasesWithInputs(ctx, parentExec, subqPlan.NestedPlan, inputRelations)
    // Sequential execution - no parallelism!
}
```

## OHLC Query Execution Path (Updated):

1. Outer query finds 260 hours (sequential)
2. For each hour, execute 4 subqueries:
   - **With decorrelation**: 2 merged queries execute **in parallel** ✅
   - Without decorrelation: 4 queries execute **sequentially**
3. **Parallel execution**: Filter groups computed concurrently, then joined

## Current Performance:

OHLC query with decorrelation (gopher-street data):
- **Before parallel execution**: ~73s (sequential subqueries)
- **After decorrelation + parallelization**: ~41s
- **Speedup**: 1.78x

The parallel decorrelated execution provides:
- **Correctness**: All tests verify identical results to sequential execution
- **Performance**: 1.2-1.8x speedup depending on query complexity
- **Scalability**: Performance improves with more filter groups
