# Part 1: Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)

## Summary

CSE was implemented to merge filter groups with identical structure but different accessed attributes. **Quantified testing shows CSE provides minimal benefit** with parallel decorrelation enabled.

## Implementation

**What CSE does:**
- Merges filter groups that have identical patterns/predicates but access different attributes
- Example: `max(price)` and `sum(stock)` queries with same `[?prod :product/category ?cat]` pattern
- Reduces 2 filter groups → 1 merged query that scans all attributes together

**Files:**
- `datalog/planner/decorrelation.go`: CSE merging logic
- `datalog/planner/types.go`: `EnableCSE` option (disabled by default)
- `datalog/executor/cse_test.go`: Correctness tests
- `datalog/executor/cse_performance_test.go`: Performance impact test
- `datalog/executor/cse_parallel_comparison_test.go`: Sequential vs parallel comparison

## Performance Results

### Test 1: CSE with Parallel Decorrelation
**File:** `cse_performance_test.go`

| Configuration | Time | Filter Groups |
|--------------|------|---------------|
| WITHOUT CSE | 13.48s | 2 (parallel) |
| WITH CSE | 13.31s | 1 (merged) |
| **Speedup** | **1.01x** | **1.3% improvement** |

**Conclusion:** CSE provides essentially 0% benefit with parallel decorrelation.

### Test 2: CSE Sequential vs Parallel (Small Scale)
**File:** `cse_parallel_comparison_test.go` (3 days, ~200 bars)

| Configuration | Time | Filter Groups |
|--------------|------|---------------|
| Sequential WITHOUT CSE | ~810ms | 2 (sequential) |
| Sequential WITH CSE | ~795ms | 1 (merged) |
| **Sequential Speedup** | **1.01-1.03x** | **1-3% improvement** |
| | | |
| Parallel WITHOUT CSE | ~788ms | 2 (parallel) |
| Parallel WITH CSE | ~795ms | 1 (merged) |
| **Parallel Speedup** | **0.99x** | **-1% (slower)** |

**Conclusion:**
- CSE provides 1-3% benefit in sequential mode
- CSE provides -1% benefit in parallel mode (slight penalty)
- **Parallel WITHOUT CSE is fastest overall**

### Test 3: CSE at Large Scale
**File:** `cse_large_scale_test.go` (8 days, 624 bars, avg of 3 runs)

| Configuration | Time | Speedup |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Sequential WITHOUT CSE | ~13.38s | baseline |
| Sequential WITH CSE | ~13.33s | 1.00x (0.3-2.0%) |
| Parallel WITHOUT CSE | ~13.30s | **FASTEST** |
| Parallel WITH CSE | ~13.35s | 1.00x (-0.3% to -1.4%) |

**Conclusion:**
- At larger scale, CSE benefits remain small (< 2%)
- All configurations: 13.3s ± 0.1s (within measurement variance)
- **Cannot make definitive claims** at this scale
- Need production-scale tests (months/years of data) for conclusive results

## Why CSE Doesn't Help

1. **Parallel execution negates benefits**
   - 2 filter groups already run concurrently
   - Merging them removes parallelism opportunity
   - Wall-clock time: 2 concurrent queries ≈ 1 merged query

2. **Merged query scans MORE data**
   - Combined: scans `[high, low, volume]` in one pass
   - Separate: scans `[high, low]` and `[volume]` in parallel
   - Parallel I/O often faster than sequential

3. **Join cost dominates**
   - Expensive operation: joining results back to input bindings
   - This happens once regardless of filter group count

## When CSE Would Help

CSE would provide measurable benefits in scenarios with:

1. **Single-threaded execution** (no parallel decorrelation)
   - Reduces N sequential queries → 1 merged query
   - Measured: 1-3% improvement in sequential mode

2. **Expensive filter predicates**
   - Complex computations applied to each row
   - CSE would compute once instead of N times
   - Our test: simple pattern scans (cheap)

3. **High query setup overhead**
   - If query initialization is expensive
   - CSE reduces N setups → 1 setup
   - Our implementation: setup is fast

4. **Sequential storage backends**
   - Databases where parallel queries don't help
   - Single-threaded index access
   - Our test: in-memory concurrent scans

## Recommendations

**Default Configuration:**
```go
EnableSubqueryDecorrelation: true  // Enable decorrelation
EnableParallelDecorrelation: true  // Execute filter groups in parallel
EnableCSE:                   false // Disabled (no benefit with parallel)
```

**When to enable CSE:**
- Single-threaded environments (embedded, WASM)
- Storage backends that serialize access
- Queries with expensive filter predicates

**Test Results:**
- ✅ CSE correctly merges filter groups (2 → 1)
- ✅ CSE produces correct results
- ✅ CSE provides 1-3% benefit in sequential mode
- ❌ CSE provides -1% benefit in parallel mode
- ⚠️  Parallel WITHOUT CSE is fastest configuration

# Part 2: Semantic Rewriting (Time Range Optimization)

## Summary

✅ **COMPLETE** - Implemented **predicate pushdown with semantic rewriting** with expression/predicate elimination.

**Simple Query Performance**: 2.6× to 5.8× speedup ✓
**Complex Query Performance**: 1.64× speedup (without decorrelation) ✓
**Combined with Decorrelation**: No overhead (1.00×) ✓

**Status**: Infrastructure complete with expression/predicate elimination. Optimization is production-ready.

**Recommended**: `EnableSemanticRewriting: true` for production use.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Time Range Constraint System
**Location**: `datalog/constraints/time_constraints.go`

Transforms time extraction predicates into efficient range checks:
- **Input**: `year(time) = 2025 AND month(time) = 6 AND day(time) = 20`
- **Output**: Single range constraint: `time ∈ [2025-06-20 00:00, 2025-06-21 00:00)`

**Key Components**:
```go
type TimeRangeConstraint struct {
    position  int       // Which datom position (E=0, A=1, V=2, Tx=3)
    startTime time.Time // Inclusive start
    endTime   time.Time // Exclusive end
}

func ComposeTimeConstraint(
    year, month, day, hour, minute, second *int,
    position int,
) *TimeRangeConstraint
```

**Constraint Composition**:
- Year constraint: `[2025-01-01, 2026-01-01)`
- Year + Month: `[2025-06-01, 2025-07-01)`
- Year + Month + Day: `[2025-06-20, 2025-06-21)`
- Year + Month + Day + Hour: `[2025-06-20 10:00, 2025-06-20 11:00)`
- And so on through minute and second granularity

### 2. Pattern Detection Logic
**Location**: `datalog/planner/predicate_rewriter.go`

Detects time extraction patterns in query plans and rewrites them:

**Detection Algorithm**:
1. Find time extraction expressions: `[(year ?time) ?y]`
2. Find equality predicates: `[(= ?y 2025)]`
3. Link expressions to predicates by result variable
4. Group by source variable (multiple extractions on same time)
5. Compose into single constraint
6. Inject constraint into pattern metadata

**Example Pattern**:
```datalog
[?b :price/time ?time]     ; Pattern that binds ?time
[(year ?time) ?y]          ; Extract year
[(month ?time) ?m]         ; Extract month
[(= ?y 2025)]              ; Year equality
[(= ?m 6)]                 ; Month equality

; Rewritten to:
[?b :price/time ?time]     ; With constraint: time ∈ [2025-06-01, 2025-07-01)
; Expressions still execute (for now) but constraint pre-filters
```

## Performance Results

### Simple Queries (2-4 time predicates)

| Query | Without Rewriting | With Rewriting | Speedup |
|-------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| Year only | 5.2ms | 2.0ms | **2.6×** |
| Year + Month | 5.3ms | 1.7ms | **3.1×** |
| Year + Month + Day | 5.4ms | 1.1ms | **4.9×** |
| Y + M + D + Hour | 5.5ms | 0.95ms | **5.8×** |

**Conclusion**: Simple time-based queries see 3-6× speedup.

### Complex OHLC Queries

**Without decorrelation**:
- Without rewriting: 67.3s
- With rewriting: 41.0s
- **Speedup: 1.64×**

**With decorrelation + parallel**:
- Without rewriting: 10.44s
- With rewriting: 10.36s
- **Speedup: 1.01× (no overhead)**

**Conclusion**: Semantic rewriting provides major benefit for non-decorrelated queries, and no overhead when combined with other optimizations.

## Implementation Details

### Storage Integration
**Location**: `datalog/storage/matcher.go`

The storage layer uses constraints during pattern matching:

```go
// Check if datom satisfies time range constraint
if constraint != nil {
    timeVal, ok := datom.V.(time.Time)
    if !ok || timeVal.Before(constraint.Start) || !timeVal.Before(constraint.End) {
        continue // Skip datom outside range
    }
}
```

### Expression Elimination
**Location**: `datalog/planner/predicate_rewriter.go`

After injecting constraint, the rewriter marks redundant expressions and predicates:
- Time extraction expressions: Marked `redundant = true`
- Equality predicates on extracted values: Marked `redundant = true`
- Executor skips redundant clauses during execution

### Correctness Validation

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests verify constraint composition
- Integration tests verify correct result sets
- Performance tests measure speedup at different scales
- Correctness: All queries produce identical results with/without rewriting

## Recommendations

**Production Configuration**:
```go
EnableSemanticRewriting: true  // 3-6× speedup on time queries, no overhead
```

**When it helps most**:
- Queries with time-based filtering (year/month/day/hour/minute)
- Large datasets with many time-indexed values
- OHLC and time-series analytics

**When it doesn't matter**:
- Queries without time predicates
- Already using decorrelation (no additional benefit)
- Small datasets (overhead dominates)
