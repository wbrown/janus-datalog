# Session Summary - October 4, 2025

## Objectives
Investigate and fix AEVT index performance issues reported in gopher-street reproduction.

## What We Successfully Completed ✅

### 1. Intern Cache Optimization (commit e3c956b)
**Problem**: 35% of CPU time spent on mutex contention in InternKeyword/InternIdentity  
**Root Cause**: Global sync.RWMutex with 8 parallel workers contending  
**Fix**: Replaced sync.RWMutex with sync.Map for lock-free reads  
**Result**: **6.26x parallel speedup** (BadgerDB test: 11.2s → 1.79s)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE, VERIFIED, PRODUCTION-READY

### 2. Iterator Reuse Visibility (commit 0565b85)
**Problem**: No visibility into datom scan counts for iterator reuse path  
**Root Cause**: reusingIterator didn't track or emit scan statistics  
**Fix**: Added datomsScanned/datomsMatched tracking + pattern/iterator-reuse-complete annotation  
**Result**: Test shows **5 scans for 3 entities** (correct behavior confirmed)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE, iterator reuse works correctly for small sets

### 3. SimpleBatchScanner AEVT Support (commit 74cb232)
**Problem**: Queries crashed with "failed to calculate scan range"  
**Root Cause**: buildKey() didn't handle E bound + A constant case (position=0 for AEVT)  
**Fix**: Check position in AEVT case, handle both E and A bindings  
**Result**: Queries no longer crash  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 4. Documentation Updates
**Commits**: 00abdf9, acf0e23, 31aa0cb  
**Files**:
- AEVT_INDEX_PERFORMANCE_BUG.md - Resolved with findings
- PERFORMANCE_STATUS.md - Updated with completed optimizations
- TODO.md - Marked AEVT bug as completed
- LARGE_BINDING_SET_DIAGNOSIS.md - New investigation plan

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## What Remains: Large Binding Set Performance

### Problem Statement
Queries with large binding sets (>1000 entities) time out (>30 seconds).

**Example**:
```
Phase 1: [?s :symbol/ticker "NVDA"] → 1 entity (57µs) ✅
Phase 2: [?b :price/symbol ?s] → 4,224 entities (2.7ms) ✅
Phase 2: [?b :price/time ?t] with 4,224 bound ?b → HANGS (>30s) ❌
```

### What We Discovered (Thrashing)
We tried multiple speculative fixes without proper diagnosis:
- ❌ Disabled SimpleBatchScanner (still hangs)
- ❌ Switched to EAVT index (still hangs)
- ❌ Disabled iterator reuse (still hangs)
- ❌ Added thresholds at 100, 1000 (still hangs)

**Lesson**: No more guessing without data.

### What We DON'T Know (Critical)
1. Where is the 30+ seconds spent? (iterator creation? seeking? scanning? decoding?)
2. How many datoms are actually scanned? (4,224 expected vs millions?)
3. Which code path executes? (reusingIterator? SimpleBatchScanner? nonReusingIterator?)

### Next Steps (Documented in LARGE_BINDING_SET_DIAGNOSIS.md)
1. **Add instrumentation**: Timing + datom counters
2. **Run diagnostics**: Capture actual data
3. **Analyze bottleneck**: Understand root cause
4. **Design fix**: Based on relational theory, not heuristics
5. **Verify**: With benchmarks

## Commits Created

1. `e3c956b` - sync.Map intern cache (6.26x speedup)
2. `525fb43` - Fix index selection for E+A bound
3. `00abdf9` - Document AEVT investigation
4. `0565b85` - Add datom tracking to iterator reuse
5. `acf0e23` - Mark AEVT bug as resolved
6. `74cb232` - Fix SimpleBatchScanner AEVT support
7. `31aa0cb` - Document large binding set investigation plan

## Code State

### Clean (No Pending Changes)
- All speculative threshold changes reverted
- Clean git working directory
- Ready for systematic diagnosis

### Test Results
- **Small binding sets (<100)**: ✅ Fast (6.26x parallel speedup)
- **Medium binding sets (100-1000)**: ❓ Untested
- **Large binding sets (>1000)**: ❌ Hangs (needs investigation)

## Key Learnings

1. **Measure before optimizing**: Intern cache profiling led to 6.26x win
2. **Verify assumptions**: Iterator reuse was working all along
3. **No speculative fixes**: Multiple threshold attempts wasted time
4. **Relational theory over heuristics**: Need to understand fundamentals
5. **Diagnose systematically**: Add instrumentation, capture data, analyze

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Next Optimization)
1. Add diagnostic logging to matcher_relations.go
2. Create benchmark for large binding sets
3. Profile with pprof on slow query
4. Identify actual bottleneck with data

### Medium Term
1. Consider parallel pattern execution (if overhead is the issue)
2. Consider hash join for large binding sets (if nested loop is wrong approach)
3. Consider streaming/batching strategies (if memory is the issue)

### Long Term
1. Statistics-based query planning (cardinality estimates)
2. Cost-based optimizer (choose join strategy based on data)
3. Adaptive execution (switch strategies at runtime)

## Bottom Line

**Big Wins**: 6.26x parallel speedup, iterator reuse verified correct  
**Remaining Issue**: Large binding sets need proper diagnosis, not more guessing  
**Next Session**: Add instrumentation, gather data, fix based on evidence
