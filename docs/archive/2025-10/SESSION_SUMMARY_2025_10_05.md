# Session Summary - October 5, 2025

## Objectives
Implement hash join strategy to fix large binding set performance issues.

## What We Successfully Completed ✅

### Hash Join Implementation (commit fa323ec)
**Problem**: Large binding sets (79-4224 entities) timing out or extremely slow
**Root Cause**: Iterator reuse scanned 31M datoms for 79 entities (excessive seeking overhead)
**Solution**: Hash join scan strategy - single scan + O(1) hash probe per datom
**Result**: **880x speedup** on gopher-street queries

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `datalog/storage/hash_join_matcher.go` with full hash join algorithm
- Modified `matcher_relations.go` to route to hash join based on selectivity
- Strategy selection: size ≤10 uses index nested loop, 11-1000 uses hash join

**Performance Results**:
```
Test 2 (aggregation with date filters):  timeout → 523ms
Test 3 (79 rows with filters):           61+ sec → 69ms (880x speedup!)
Test 4 (simple subquery):                fast    → 35ms (already optimal)
Test 5 (complex OHLC 4 subqueries):      27 sec  → 210ms (128x speedup!)
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Datoms scanned: 31,173,242 → 12,480 (2,497x reduction!)
- Hash probe efficiency: 79 hits / 12,480 probes = 0.63% selectivity
- Single scan + hash lookup vs 79 separate seeks

## Technical Insights

### Why Iterator Reuse Failed
Iterator reuse with Seek() had hidden costs:
1. **Seek overhead**: BadgerDB LSM-tree seeks aren't free
2. **Boundary checking**: Complex logic to detect "moved past" binding
3. **Wide iteration**: Still scanned datoms between entities
4. **79 seeks × overhead** > **1 scan + 12,480 hash probes**

### Why Hash Join Won
Relational algebra theory proved correct:
1. **Build phase**: O(n) = 79 hash set inserts (negligible)
2. **Probe phase**: O(m) = 12,480 datoms × O(1) hash lookup
3. **Total**: O(n + m) = ~12,500 operations
4. **vs Iterator reuse**: O(n × log m) with high constant factor

### Selectivity-Based Strategy Selection
```
Binding Size    Selectivity    Strategy           Rationale
≤ 10           any             Index Nested Loop  Hash overhead not worth it
11-1000        any             Hash Join          Proven reliable
>1000          <50%            Hash Join          Single scan optimal
>1000          >50%            Hash Join          Future: merge join
```

## Code State

### Clean Implementation
- Hash join fully tested on gopher-street queries
- Comprehensive annotations for debugging
- Clear strategy selection logic
- No performance regressions on small binding sets

### Test Results
- **Small binding sets (1-10)**: ✅ Fast with index nested loop
- **Medium binding sets (11-1000)**: ✅ Fast with hash join (69ms for 79 entities)
- **Large binding sets (1000-5000)**: ✅ Fast with hash join (523ms for 4224 entities)

## What Remains

### Iterator Reuse Still Used (< 10 entities)
For very small binding sets, index nested loop is still optimal. This is correct.

### Merge Join (Future Optimization)
For very large binding sets (>10,000) with high selectivity (>50%), merge join
would be more efficient. Not needed for current workloads.

## Key Learnings

1. **Relational algebra > heuristics**: Theory predicted hash join would win
2. **Measure, don't guess**: Iterator reuse looked good on paper, failed in practice
3. **Single scan beats many seeks**: LSM-tree architecture favors sequential scans
4. **Selectivity matters**: 0.63% selectivity = hash join, not nested loop
5. **Simplicity wins**: Hash join code is simpler and faster than iterator reuse

## Commits Created

1. `fa323ec` - Hash join strategy implementation with 880x speedup

## Bottom Line

**Big Win**: 880x speedup on production queries, 2,497x reduction in datoms scanned
**Validation**: Relational algebra theory proven correct in practice
**Status**: Large binding set performance issue RESOLVED ✅
