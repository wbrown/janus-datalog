# Streaming Aggregation Nil Bug Investigation

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Component**: `datalog/executor/aggregation.go` - StreamingAggregateRelation
**Status**: Pre-existing bug, NOT caused by October 10 subquery fixes

---

## Executive Summary

Pure aggregations (max, min, avg, sum) return `nil` values instead of computed results when using **streaming aggregation** (>100 rows). The bug does NOT occur with **batch aggregation** (<100 rows).

**Key Finding**: This is a pre-existing bug in `StreamingAggregateRelation`, NOT a regression from today's subquery nil fixes. The subquery fixes are correct and working as intended.

---

## Discovery Timeline

1. **Initial Report**: `PURE_AGGREGATION_NIL_BUG.md` claimed October 10 fixes broke all aggregations
2. **Investigation**: Created test with BadgerDB - all aggregations PASSED (used batch mode)
3. **Confusion**: gopher-street queries returned nil, but tests passed
4. **Root Cause**: Discovered streaming vs batch aggregation difference
   - Test used 3 rows → batch aggregation → ✅ works
   - gopher-street used 2456 rows → streaming aggregation → ❌ returns nil
5. **Confirmation**: Disabled streaming in gopher-street → aggregations work perfectly

---

## Reproduction

### Test Case

Created `datalog/storage/pure_aggregation_badger_test.go` with 150 rows to trigger streaming:

```bash
cd /Users/wbrown/go/src/github.com/wbrown/janus-datalog
go test -v ./datalog/storage -run TestPureAggregationWithBadgerDB
```

**Results with StreamingAggregation = true:**
```
NonAggregated:        ✅ PASS (150 rows returned)
PureMaxAggregation:   ❌ FAIL (returns nil, expected 249.0)
PureMinAggregation:   ❌ FAIL (returns nil, expected 100.0)
PureCountAggregation: ✅ PASS (returns 150)
```

**Test Robustness**: The test uses annotations to verify streaming aggregation is actually used. If the `StreamingAggregationThreshold` changes (e.g., from 100 to 200), the test will fail with a clear error message:

```
TEST CONFIGURATION ERROR: This test must use streaming aggregation to reproduce the bug, but used 'batch'.
Either increase test data size (currently 150 rows) or decrease StreamingAggregationThreshold (currently 100).
```

This ensures the test continues to reproduce the streaming bug even if implementation details change.

### gopher-street Reproduction

```bash
cd /Users/wbrown/go/src/github.com/wbrown/gopher-street

# With streaming enabled (default)
./gopher-street query '[:find (max ?h) :where [?s :symbol/ticker "CRWV"] [?p :price/symbol ?s] [?p :price/high ?h]]' -s CRWV
# Result: nil ❌

# With streaming disabled (EnableStreamingAggregation = false)
./gopher-street query '[:find (max ?h) :where [?s :symbol/ticker "CRWV"] [?p :price/symbol ?s] [?p :price/high ?h]]' -s CRWV
# Result: 155.00 ✅
```

---

## Technical Details

### Streaming Aggregation Threshold

From `datalog/executor/aggregation.go`:

```go
const StreamingAggregationThreshold = 100

// Streaming is used when:
useStreaming := EnableStreamingAggregation &&
    len(aggregates) > 0 &&
    isStreamingEligible(aggregates) &&
    shouldUseStreaming(rel)  // Checks if rel.Size() >= StreamingAggregationThreshold
```

### Affected Aggregations

| Function | Batch (<100 rows) | Streaming (≥100 rows) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| count    | ✅ Works          | ✅ Works             |
| sum      | ✅ Works          | ❌ Returns nil       |
| avg      | ✅ Works          | ❌ Returns nil       |
| min      | ✅ Works          | ❌ Returns nil       |
| max      | ✅ Works          | ❌ Returns nil       |

**Pattern**: `count` works because it doesn't require column matching. All value-based aggregations fail.

### Debug Output

With `debugAggregation = true` and `EnableStreamingAggregationDebug = true`:

```
[ExecuteAggregations] Called with 1 find elements, rel columns: [?h ?s]
[ExecuteAggregations] Element 0: FindAggregate - Function=max, Arg=?h
[ExecuteAggregations] Extracted 1 aggregates, 0 groupByVars: []
[ExecuteAggregations] aggregates=1, eligible=true, shouldUse=true, useStreaming=true, relType=*executor.MaterializedRelation, relSize=2456
[ExecuteAggregations] Using STREAMING aggregation (groupByVars=[])
```

Note: Relation has correct columns `[?h ?s]`, but streaming aggregation returns nil.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis

`StreamingAggregateRelation` has a bug in how it:
1. Matches aggregate argument variables (?h) to relation columns
2. Extracts values from tuples during iteration
3. Computes final aggregate results

The bug is likely in one of these methods:
- `StreamingAggregateRelation.Iterator()` - Creates iterator for streaming computation
- `StreamingAggregateRelation.Columns()` - Returns result columns
- Internal aggregation accumulator logic

### Why Count Works

`count` doesn't need to extract column values - it just counts tuples:

```go
case "count":
    return int64(len(values))  // Doesn't depend on tuple content
```

But `max`, `min`, `avg`, `sum` all need to:
1. Find the column index for the aggregate argument
2. Extract values from that column
3. Compute the aggregate

The column matching or value extraction is failing in streaming mode.

## Impact Assessment

### What's Broken
- ❌ All gopher-street OHLC queries (uses streaming aggregation)
- ❌ Any query with >100 results that uses max/min/avg/sum
- ❌ Production analytics and statistics on large datasets

### What Still Works
- ✅ Queries with <100 results (uses batch aggregation)
- ✅ Count aggregations (doesn't need column matching)
- ✅ Grouped aggregations (may use different code path)
- ✅ All October 10 subquery fixes (NOT related to this bug)

### Workaround

**Temporary fix for gopher-street**:

In `/Users/wbrown/go/src/github.com/wbrown/janus-datalog/datalog/executor/aggregation.go`:

```go
var EnableStreamingAggregation = false
```

Then rebuild gopher-street:
```bash
cd /Users/wbrown/go/src/github.com/wbrown/gopher-street
go build -o gopher-street .
```

**Performance impact**: Batch aggregation uses more memory (O(tuples) vs O(groups)) but is still fast for most queries.

---

## Incorrect Blame

### PURE_AGGREGATION_NIL_BUG.md Was Wrong

The bug report claimed:

> **Introduced By**: October 10, 2025 fixes for nil aggregation values

This is **incorrect**. The October 10 fixes:
- ✅ Fixed empty subquery aggregations correctly
- ✅ Work perfectly with batch aggregation
- ✅ Have no code interaction with streaming aggregation
- ✅ Pass all existing tests

### Correct Attribution

- **Bug introduced**: Unknown (pre-existing in StreamingAggregateRelation)
- **Bug discovered**: October 10, 2025 (during gopher-street testing)
- **October 10 fixes**: Unrelated and working correctly

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Streaming Aggregation

Investigate `StreamingAggregateRelation` in `datalog/executor/aggregation.go`:

```go
type StreamingAggregateRelation struct {
    source      Relation
    groupByVars []query.Symbol
    aggregates  []query.FindAggregate
    // ... accumulator state
}

func (r *StreamingAggregateRelation) Iterator() Iterator {
    // BUG IS LIKELY HERE
    // Check column matching logic
    // Check value extraction from tuples
    // Check aggregate computation
}
```

### 2. Add Comprehensive Tests

Tests needed:
- ✅ Pure aggregations with <100 rows (batch mode) - EXISTS
- ✅ Pure aggregations with >100 rows (streaming mode) - EXISTS (now fails correctly)
- ⏳ Grouped aggregations with streaming
- ⏳ Multiple aggregates in one query with streaming
- ⏳ Conditional aggregates with streaming

### 3. Compare Implementations

Compare streaming vs batch implementations to find divergence:
- `executeSingleAggregation()` (batch) - ✅ works
- `StreamingAggregateRelation` (streaming) - ❌ broken

Look for differences in:
- Column index lookup
- Tuple value extraction
- Nil value handling

---

## Testing Strategy

### Verify Fix

After fixing StreamingAggregateRelation:

```bash
# 1. Unit tests pass
go test -v ./datalog/executor -run TestAggregate
go test -v ./datalog/storage -run TestPureAggregation

# 2. gopher-street works
cd /Users/wbrown/go/src/github.com/wbrown/gopher-street
go test -v -run TestToolCalculateISOStrategy

# 3. Both streaming and batch work
# Change threshold temporarily to test both paths
```

### Performance Validation

After fix, verify streaming still provides benefits:
- Memory usage: O(groups) not O(tuples) for large datasets
- Speed: Similar or faster than batch for >1000 rows
- Correctness: Exact same results as batch aggregation

2. **Streaming aggregation has pre-existing bug** - Affects max/min/avg/sum with >100 rows
3. **Batch aggregation works perfectly** - Can be used as temporary workaround
4. **Bug is isolated and reproducible** - Test case exists, root cause identified
5. **Fix is straightforward** - Compare streaming vs batch implementations

**Priority**: HIGH - Affects all large-dataset analytics in gopher-street

**Recommended Action**: Fix `StreamingAggregateRelation` iterator logic to match batch aggregation behavior for column matching and value extraction.

## Fix Applied (October 10, 2025)

### Root Cause

The bug was actually **TWO separate bugs** in `StreamingAggregateRelation.materialize()`:

#### Bug 1: Column Index Initialization

Lines 732-743 initialized column index arrays to 0 (default int value) instead of -1:

```go
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
aggIndices := make([]int, len(r.aggregates))
for i, agg := range r.aggregates {
    for j, col := range columns {
        if col == agg.Arg {
            aggIndices[i] = j
            break
        }
    }
}
// If column not found, aggIndices[i] remains 0 (WRONG - uses first column)
```

**Impact**: When aggregate argument column was not found, index 0 was used, causing wrong column data to be aggregated.

**Fix**: Initialize indices to -1 and check for >= 0 before use:

```go
// AFTER (FIXED):
aggIndices := make([]int, len(r.aggregates))
for i := range aggIndices {
    aggIndices[i] = -1 // Initialize to -1 (not found)
}
for i, agg := range r.aggregates {
    for j, col := range columns {
        if col == agg.Arg {
            aggIndices[i] = j
            break
        }
    }
}

// And when using:
if idx >= 0 && idx < len(tuple) {
    value := tuple[idx]
    states[i].Update(agg.Function, value)
}
```

The same fix was applied to `groupIndices` for consistency.

#### Bug 2: AggregateState Count Not Incremented

Lines 501-510 in `AggregateState.Update()` didn't increment count for min/max:

```go
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
case "min":
    if s.min == nil || datalog.CompareValues(value, s.min) < 0 {
        s.min = value
    }
    // Missing: s.count++

case "max":
    if s.max == nil || datalog.CompareValues(value, s.max) > 0 {
        s.max = value
    }
    // Missing: s.count++
```

But lines 531-541 in `GetResult()` checked count and returned nil:

```go
case "min":
    if s.count == 0 {  // Always 0 for min/max!
        return nil
    }
    return s.min

case "max":
    if s.count == 0 {  // Always 0 for min/max!
        return nil
    }
    return s.max
```

**Impact**: Even when values were correctly aggregated, `GetResult()` returned nil because count was 0.

**Fix**: Increment count in Update() for min/max:

```go
// AFTER (FIXED):
case "min":
    if s.min == nil || datalog.CompareValues(value, s.min) < 0 {
        s.min = value
    }
    s.count++

case "max":
    if s.max == nil || datalog.CompareValues(value, s.max) > 0 {
        s.max = value
    }
    s.count++
```

### Files Modified

- `datalog/executor/aggregation.go`:
  - Lines 723-758: Added -1 initialization for groupIndices and aggIndices
  - Lines 776-794: Added >= 0 checks when using indices
  - Lines 501-511: Added count++ for min/max in Update()

### Verification

All tests pass after fix:

```bash
# BadgerDB test with 150 rows (streaming mode)
go test -v ./datalog/storage -run TestPureAggregationWithBadgerDB
# Result: ✅ PASS - All aggregations return correct values

# Existing aggregation tests (batch mode)
go test -v ./datalog/executor -run TestAggregate
# Result: ✅ PASS - No regressions

# Streaming aggregation tests
go test -v ./datalog/executor -run TestStreaming
# Result: ✅ PASS - Streaming works correctly

# Decorrelation tests (pure aggregations)
go test -v ./datalog/executor -run TestDecorrelation
# Result: ✅ PASS - Pure aggregations not decorrelated (correct)
```

### Debug Logging Added

Added temporary debug logging to diagnose the issue:

- Lines 723-727: Log source columns, group-by vars, and aggregates
- Lines 755-758: Log computed indices
- Lines 787-789: Log tuples being processed
- Lines 836-838: Log aggregate updates
- Lines 848-850: Log total tuples and groups processed
- Lines 864-867: Log GetResult() values and state

This logging is controlled by `EnableStreamingAggregationDebug` flag (currently disabled).

### Performance Impact

None - the fixes are purely correctness fixes:
- Index initialization to -1: Same O(1) initialization
- Index checking >= 0: Same O(1) check
- Count increment: Same O(1) operation

The streaming aggregation performance characteristics remain unchanged:
- Memory: O(groups) instead of O(tuples)
- Time: Single pass over data
- Threshold: 100 rows (unchanged)

### Status

**RESOLVED** - Both bugs fixed, all tests pass, no regressions.

The October 10 subquery fixes remain correct and working as intended.
