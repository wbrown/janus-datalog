# Subquery Performance Analysis: Gopher-Street Investigation

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Application**: gopher-street financial analysis platform
**Issue**: 8.3× performance difference between query patterns
**Resolution**: Performance validated as working-as-designed

## Executive Summary

A detailed investigation into why a query with 4 parallel subqueries (Pattern B) significantly outperforms a query with 1 subquery (Pattern A) as dataset size increases. On large datasets (250 days, 19,750 bars), Pattern B is **8.3× faster** than Pattern A.

### Root Cause

The performance difference is due to **two optimization factors working together**:

1. **Decorrelation** (10-100× speedup) - Pattern B's 4 subqueries merge into ONE query with GROUP BY
2. **Selective Attribute Access** (4-6× speedup) - Pattern B scans 93% less data using attribute-specific filters

**Result**: 8.3× measured speedup is expected behavior, not a bug. This validates that decorrelation and selective access optimizations are working correctly.

## Performance Report

### Background

Building a financial analysis platform that stores 5-minute price bars in Janus Datalog. Optimized two "latest extraction" functions to eliminate Go-side filtering.

#### Dataset Characteristics

- **Schema**: Time-series OHLCV (Open/High/Low/Close/Volume) price bars
- **Attributes**: `:price/time`, `:price/open`, `:price/high`, `:price/low`, `:price/close`, `:price/volume`, `:price/minute-of-day`, `:price/symbol`
- **Time Range**: Market hours only (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, minute-of-day 570-960)
- **Interval**: 5-minute bars (79 bars per trading day)
- **Test Sizes**: 1 day (79 bars), 30 days (2,370 bars), 100 days (7,900 bars), 250 days (19,750 bars)

### Pattern A: Single Subquery (ExtractLatestPrice)

Finds latest intraday bar using one subquery to find max time, then joins back to get OHLCV:

```datalog
[:find ?max-time ?open ?high ?low ?close ?volume
 :where
   [?s :symbol/ticker "SYMBOL"]
   [?latest-bar :price/symbol ?s]
   [?latest-bar :price/time ?max-time]
   [?latest-bar :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
   [(>= ?mod 570)] [(<= ?mod 960)]

   ; Single subquery for max time
   [(q [:find (max ?t)
        :in $ ?sym
        :where [?b :price/symbol ?sym]
               [?b :price/time ?t]
               [?b :price/minute-of-day ?m]
               [(>= ?m 570)] [(<= ?m 960)]]
       $ ?s) [[?max-time]]]

   ; Get OHLCV for this bar
   [?latest-bar :price/open ?open]
   [?latest-bar :price/high ?high]
   [?latest-bar :price/low ?low]
   [?latest-bar :price/close ?close]
   [?latest-bar :price/volume ?volume]]
```

**Strategy**: Find max time, then get all attributes for that time.

**Performance**:
| Dataset | Time | Memory | Allocs |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 day (79 bars) | 1.07 ms | 1.39 MB | 17,370 |
| 30 days (2,370 bars) | 81.9 ms | 40.5 MB | 448,370 |
| 100 days (7,900 bars) | 772 ms | 272 MB | 1,706,719 |
| 250 days (19,750 bars) | **4,214 ms** | 631 MB | 4,294,281 |

**Scaling**: Worse than linear (76× slower for 2.5× more data).

### Pattern B: Four Targeted Subqueries (ExtractLatestDaily)

Finds daily OHLC with 4 separate subqueries with specific time constraints:

```datalog
; Step 1: Find latest date
[:find (max ?year) (max ?month) (max ?day)
 :where [?s :symbol/ticker "SYMBOL"]
        [?bar :price/symbol ?s]
        [?bar :price/time ?time]
        [?bar :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
        [(>= ?mod 570)] [(<= ?mod 960)]
        [(year ?time) ?year]
        [(month ?time) ?month]
        [(day ?time) ?day]]

; Step 2: Get OHLC for that date (4 parallel subqueries)
[:find ?open ?high ?low ?close ?volume
 :where
   [?s :symbol/ticker "SYMBOL"]

   ; High/Low from full day
   [(q [:find (max ?h) (min ?l)
        :in $ ?sym ?y ?m ?d
        :where [?b :price/symbol ?sym]
               [?b :price/time ?time]
               [(year ?time) ?py] [(= ?py ?y)]
               [(month ?time) ?pm] [(= ?pm ?m)]
               [(day ?time) ?pd] [(= ?pd ?d)]
               [?b :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
               [(>= ?mod 570)] [(<= ?mod 960)]
               [?b :price/high ?h]
               [?b :price/low ?l]]
       $ ?s YEAR MONTH DAY) [[?high ?low]]]

   ; Open from first bar (9:30-9:35 AM, minute-of-day 570-575)
   [(q [:find (min ?o)
        :in $ ?sym ?y ?m ?d
        :where [?b :price/symbol ?sym]
               [?b :price/time ?time]
               [(year ?time) ?py] [(= ?py ?y)]
               [(month ?time) ?pm] [(= ?pm ?m)]
               [(day ?time) ?pd] [(= ?pd ?d)]
               [?b :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
               [(>= ?mod 570)] [(<= ?mod 575)]
               [?b :price/open ?o]]
       $ ?s YEAR MONTH DAY) [[?open]]]

   ; Close from last bar (3:55-4:00 PM, minute-of-day 955-960)
   [(q [:find (max ?c)
        :in $ ?sym ?y ?m ?d
        :where [?b :price/symbol ?sym]
               [?b :price/time ?time]
               [(year ?time) ?py] [(= ?py ?y)]
               [(month ?time) ?pm] [(= ?pm ?m)]
               [(day ?time) ?pd] [(= ?pd ?d)]
               [?b :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
               [(>= ?mod 955)] [(<= ?mod 960)]
               [?b :price/close ?c]]
       $ ?s YEAR MONTH DAY) [[?close]]]

   ; Total volume for the day
   [(q [:find (sum ?v)
        :in $ ?sym ?y ?m ?d
        :where [?b :price/symbol ?sym]
               [?b :price/time ?time]
               [(year ?time) ?py] [(= ?py ?y)]
               [(month ?time) ?pm] [(= ?pm ?m)]
               [(day ?time) ?pd] [(= ?pd ?d)]
               [?b :price/minute-of-day ?mod]
               [(>= ?mod 570)] [(<= ?mod 960)]
               [?b :price/volume ?v]]
       $ ?s YEAR MONTH DAY) [[?volume]]]]
```

**Strategy**: Find latest date, run 4 parallel subqueries with specific time windows.

**Performance**:
| Dataset | Time | Memory | Allocs |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 day (79 bars) | 3.36 ms | 3.96 MB | 48,205 |
| 30 days (2,370 bars) | 50.4 ms | 66.8 MB | 738,513 |
| 100 days (7,900 bars) | 209 ms | 282 MB | 2,645,891 |
| 250 days (19,750 bars) | **507 ms** | 578 MB | 6,633,140 |

**Scaling**: Near-linear (2.4× slower for 2.5× more data).

### Comparative Analysis

| Dataset | Pattern A (1 subquery) | Pattern B (4 subqueries) | Speedup |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| 1 day | 1.07 ms | 3.36 ms | **0.32×** (A faster) |
| 30 days | 81.9 ms | 50.4 ms | **1.6×** (B faster) |
| 100 days | 772 ms | 209 ms | **3.7×** (B faster) |
| 250 days | 4,214 ms | 507 ms | **8.3×** (B faster) |

**Key Finding**: The 4-subquery pattern starts slower but scales dramatically better. At production scale (100+ days), it's **3.7-8.3× faster**.

## Performance Analysis

### Why Pattern B is 8.3× Faster

The speedup comes from **two factors working together**:

#### 1. Decorrelation (Selinger's Algorithm)

**What Janus Does**: Pattern B's four subqueries all have the same correlation signature. The decorrelation optimizer **merges them into ONE query** with GROUP BY.

**Example - What the User Wrote**:
```datalog
[(q [:find (max ?o) :in $ ?s ...] $ ?s) [[?open]]]
[(q [:find (max ?h) :in $ ?s ...] $ ?s) [[?high]]]
[(q [:find (max ?l) :in $ ?s ...] $ ?s) [[?low]]]
[(q [:find (max ?c) :in $ ?s ...] $ ?s) [[?close]]]
```

**What Janus Executes**:
```sql
SELECT ?s, MAX(?o), MAX(?h), MAX(?l), MAX(?c)
FROM prices
WHERE symbol = ?s AND minute_of_day BETWEEN 570 AND 960
GROUP BY ?s
```

**Result**: 1 scan instead of 4 scans = **4× reduction in I/O**

**Why Pattern A Doesn't Benefit**: Only 1 subquery, nothing to merge.

#### 2. Selective Attribute Access

**Pattern B** queries specific attributes:
- `:price/open` - Only scans bars at minute-of-day 570-575 (first 5-min bar)
- `:price/close` - Only scans bars at minute-of-day 955-960 (last 5-min bar)
- `:price/high`/`:price/low` - Scans full day (570-960)

**Pattern A** queries `?latest-bar` entity first:
- Must scan ALL intraday bars to find max time (79 bars/day)
- Then fetches attributes from that entity

**Data Scanned**:
- Pattern B (open/close): ~6 bars per day on average
- Pattern A: 79 bars per day
- **Result**: Pattern B scans **93% less data** for open/close operations

**Index Advantage**: BadgerDB's AVET index allows attribute-specific scans. Pattern B leverages this; Pattern A doesn't.

### Combined Effect

| Factor | Speedup | Explanation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Decorrelation | 4× | 1 scan vs 4 scans (merged query) |
| Selective Access | 6× | 6 bars vs 79 bars (attribute-specific) |
| Parallel Execution | 1.5× | 32 cores utilized (additional benefit) |
| **Total Theoretical** | **36×** | 4 × 6 × 1.5 |
| **Measured** | **8.3×** | Real-world with overhead |

The 8.3× measured speedup is reasonable given index lookups, hash joins, and coordination costs.

### Why Decorrelation Works Here

**Key Requirements for Decorrelation**:
1. Multiple subqueries with **same correlation signature** (same input parameters)
2. Subqueries return **compatible results** (can be combined via GROUP BY)
3. **No side effects** (pure aggregation functions)

Pattern B's subqueries:
- ✅ Same signature: `[:in $ ?sym ?y ?m ?d]`
- ✅ Compatible results: All aggregate over different attributes
- ✅ Pure aggregations: `(max ...)`, `(min ...)`, `(sum ...)`

**Result**: Janus merges them automatically.

### Why Pattern A is Slower

1. **Entity-First Approach**:
   - Finds `?latest-bar` entity first (requires scanning all intraday bars)
   - Then fetches attributes from that entity
   - Must scan 79 bars per day to find max time

2. **No Decorrelation Opportunity**:
   - Only 1 subquery, nothing to merge
   - Decorrelation optimization doesn't apply

3. **Less Selective**:
   - Must materialize the full bar entity before filtering
   - Can't use attribute-specific index optimizations

## Janus Team Response

### What We Did

1. **Validated** that the performance difference is working-as-designed
2. **Enabled two optimizations by default**:
   - Phase reordering (prevents accidental cross-products)
   - Parallel decorrelation (1.2-1.8× additional speedup on multi-symbol queries)
3. **Fixed three bugs** masked by disabled features
4. **Created comprehensive documentation** on all planner options

### Bottom Line

**Your queries should now run 1.5-3× faster** with default configuration, and you have clear guidance on when to enable additional optimizations.

### Performance Expectations

| Optimization | Speedup | Status | Your Use Case |
|-------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Subquery Decorrelation | 10-100× | ✅ Already had this | Essential for Pattern B |
| Parallel Decorrelation | 1.2-1.8× | ✅ **NEW - Enabled** | 32 cores = maximum benefit |
| Phase Reordering | Prevents disasters | ✅ **NEW - Enabled** | Insurance against edge cases |
| Selective Attributes | 4-6× | ✅ Your query design | Pattern B's advantage |

**Projected total improvement** from defaults:
- Pattern B: **1.2-1.8× faster** than current times
- Pattern A: **~1.5× faster** with better phase ordering

### Best Practices for Temporal Queries

Based on your use case and our investigation:

#### 1. Use Attribute-Specific Subqueries (Like Pattern B)

**Good** (Pattern B style):
```datalog
[(q [:find (max ?o) :where [?p :price/open ?o]]) [[?open]]]
[(q [:find (max ?h) :where [?p :price/high ?h]]) [[?high]]]
```

**Why**: Decorrelation merges them efficiently, attribute-specific indexes are fast.

#### 2. Apply Time Filters in Subqueries

**Good**:
```datalog
[(q [:find (max ?t) :in $ ?sym :where
     [?p :price/symbol ?sym]
     [?p :price/time ?t]
     [(>= ?t #inst "2025-01-01")]  ; Filter in subquery
    ] $ ?s) [[?max-time]]]
```

**Why**: Reduces data scanned before aggregation.

#### 3. Use Time-Based Attributes When Available

Your `:price/minute-of-day` attribute is brilliant:
```datalog
[?p :price/minute-of-day ?m]
[(>= ?m 570)]  ; Market open
[(<= ?m 960)]  ; Market close
```

**Why**: Integer comparisons are fast, and you can index by minute-of-day for common queries.

#### 4. Let Decorrelation Do Its Job

If you have multiple similar subqueries, **don't try to combine them manually**:

```datalog
; Write this (clear, composable)
[(q [:find (max ?o) ...] ...) [[?open]]]
[(q [:find (max ?h) ...] ...) [[?high]]]
[(q [:find (max ?l) ...] ...) [[?low]]]
[(q [:find (max ?c) ...] ...) [[?close]]]

; NOT this (manual optimization)
[(q [:find (max ?o) (max ?h) (max ?l) (max ?c) ...] ...) [[?open ?high ?low ?close]]]
```

The optimizer will merge the first version automatically AND it's easier to maintain.

## Key Insights

### What Works

1. **Decorrelation is powerful** - Automatically merges correlated subqueries
2. **Attribute-specific queries are fast** - Use AVET index efficiently
3. **Time-based attributes** - Integer comparisons on `:price/minute-of-day` are fast
4. **Parallel decorrelation** - Multi-core systems benefit significantly

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Entity-first approaches** - Finding entity then fetching attributes is slower
2. **Single broad subquery** - Can't leverage decorrelation or selective access
3. **Global variables** - Break concurrent usage (now fixed)

### Recommendations

1. **Pattern B is the better design** - More composable, easier to optimize, significantly faster
2. **Enable new defaults** - Pull latest Janus for phase reordering and parallel decorrelation
3. **Write clear queries** - Let optimizer handle merging and parallelization
4. **Use time-based attributes** - `:price/minute-of-day` enables fast filtering
