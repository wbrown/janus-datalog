  - Refactoring plans

- **optimization-attempts/** - Historical optimization work
  - Profiling results
  - Benchmarking studies
  - Implementation attempts (both successful and failed)

- **obsolete/** - Superseded documentation
  - Old architecture docs
  - Outdated status files
  - Historical reference only

### By Time Period

- **2025-10/** - October 2025 optimization sprint

## Navigation

Each subdirectory contains a README explaining:
- What's in that directory
- Why it's archived
- Where to find current information

For active work, see:
- Root documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md)
- `docs/wip/` for work in progress
- `docs/ideas/` for future proposals
