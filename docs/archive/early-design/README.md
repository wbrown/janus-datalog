# Early Design Documents

Original design exploration and analysis documents from the initial implementation phase.

## Context

These documents represent the initial analysis and design exploration when building Janus Datalog. The actual implementation (see CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE.md for current state) took a more pragmatic approach in many areas while implementing additional features.

## Historical Documents

### Original Analysis
- **DATALOG_GO_NOTES_HISTORICAL_INSIGHTS.md** - Key insights from 2,100-line design exploration
  - Extracted insights on relation collapsing, storage design, type system philosophy
  - Performance pitfalls discovered during implementation
- **KEY_ORDERING_DISCOVERY.md** - Storage key format exploration

### Storage Layer
- **FIXED_KEYS_ANALYSIS.md** - Fixed-size key design (implemented)
- **compare_key_formats.md** - Key format comparison
- **badger-optimization.md** - Early BadgerDB optimization ideas

### Performance Exploration
- **ITERATOR_REUSE_ANALYSIS.md** - Iterator reuse pattern exploration
- **ITERATOR_REUSE_PLAN.md** - Initial reuse strategy planning
- **iterator-reuse-implementation-plan.md** - Detailed implementation plan
- **datalog-performance-investigation.md** - Early performance investigation

### Execution Strategy
- **sequential-pattern-execution-plan.md** - Phase-based execution design

## What Changed

Many ideas evolved during implementation:
- **Type system**: Simplified from original variant-based design
- **Iterator reuse**: Multiple iterations before finding optimal approach
- **Storage keys**: Fixed 72-byte design proved correct
- **Query execution**: Phase-based planning with relation collapsing

See `docs/archive/completed/` for final implementations.
