## Major Achievements

### 1. Parallel Subquery Execution (5.2× speedup)

**Problem**: Sequential subquery iteration for OHLC queries
- 147 hours × 4-5 subqueries = 588-735 sequential executions
- Execution time: 18.23 seconds

**Solution**: Worker pool for concurrent execution
- Fixed-size pool (runtime.NumCPU() workers)
- Query plan reuse across iterations
- Thread-safe result collection

**Results**:
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Execution time | 18.23s | 3.49s | 5.22× faster |
| Memory | 19.6 GB | 19.3 GB | Stable |

**Implementation**: `datalog/executor/subquery.go`

### 2. Intern Cache Optimization (6.26× speedup)

**Problem**: Lock contention on keyword intern cache
- 35% CPU time in sync.RWMutex operations
- Bottleneck for parallel query execution

### 3. In-Memory Indexing (49-4802× speedup)

**Problem**: Linear O(N) scans for pattern matching in MemoryPatternMatcher
- Entity lookups: 54µs for 1,000 datoms
- Test suite: Timing out on larger datasets

**Solution**: Hash-based indices for O(1) lookups
- Entity index, attribute index, value index, EA compound index
- Smart index selection (EA > E > A > V > linear)
- Thread-safe lazy initialization

**Results**:
| Dataset Size | Before | After | Speedup |
|--------------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1,000 datoms | 54µs | 1.1µs | 49× |
| 10,000 datoms | 531µs | 961ns | 553× |
| 100,000 datoms | 5.27ms | 1.1µs | 4,802× |

**Impact**: Test suite now runs in 7 seconds (down from timeouts)

**Implementation**: `datalog/executor/indexed_memory_matcher.go`

### 4. Memory Optimizations (61% reduction)

**Four-part optimization**:

#### A. Lazy Materialization (14.5% reduction)
**Problem**: StreamingRelation materialized upfront
**Solution**: Lazy materialization with sync.Once
**Result**: 24.2 GB → 20.7 GB

#### B. Tuple Builder Caching (15% reduction)

#### D. Pre-allocated Slices (6% reduction)
**Problem**: Slice growth via append()
**Solution**: Pre-allocate with known capacity
**Result**: 16.8 GB → 15.7 GB

**Combined**: 48.8 GB → 19.2 GB (61% total reduction)

---

### 5. Hash Join Pre-Sizing (24-32% faster)

**Problem**: Hash maps growing dynamically during joins

**Solution**: Pre-size maps based on relation sizes
```go
// Before
m := make(map[TupleKey][]Tuple)

// After
m := make(map[TupleKey][]Tuple, leftSize)
```

**Results**:
| Size | Time Improvement | Memory Reduction |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| 100 | 25% faster | 24% less |
| 1,000 | 32% faster | 30% less |
| 10,000 | 7% faster | 26% less |

**Implementation**: `datalog/executor/relation.go`

---

### 6. Time Range Optimization (4× speedup)

**Problem**: Hourly OHLC queries taking 41 seconds

**Solution**: Extract time ranges and use multi-range AVET scanning
- Time range extraction from correlation keys (10µs for 260 ranges)
- Multi-range BadgerDB scanning
- Size check optimization (<50 tuples skip extraction)

**Results**:
- Hourly OHLC (260 hours): 41s → 10.2s (4× faster)
- Daily OHLC (22 days): 217ms → 217ms (no regression)

**Implementation**: `datalog/storage/matcher.go`

---

### 7. Semantic Rewriting (2-6× on time queries)

**Problem**: Redundant time extraction in filters

**Solution**: Transform time predicates into storage constraints
- Convert `[(year ?t) ?y] [(= ?y 2025)]` → year=2025 constraint
- Push constraints to storage layer
- Skip optimized expressions/predicates

**Results**:
| Filter Type | Selectivity | Speedup |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Year only | 33% | 2.6× |
| Year+Month+Day | 12.5% | 4.1× |
| Year+Month+Day+Hour | 1.4% | 5.8× |

**Note**: With decorrelation enabled, shows no additional speedup (both optimize same bottleneck)

**Implementation**: `datalog/planner/semantic_rewriting.go`

---

### 8. Common Subexpression Elimination (Evaluated, Disabled)

**Evaluated**: CSE merges filter groups with identical structure

**Results**:
- Sequential: 1-3% improvement
- Parallel: -1% (removes parallelism opportunity)

**Decision**: Disabled by default
**Rationale**: Parallel execution provides better gains

**Configuration**: `EnableCSE: false` (default)

   - Simpler iterator creation was faster
   - Premature optimization

3. **Aggressive Unique Counting**
   - 150× slowdown from annotation overhead

## Future Work

### High Priority
1. **BadgerDB time range integration** - Use constraints for index scans
