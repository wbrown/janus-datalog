## Executive Summary

The Janus-Datalog codebase contains **at least three high-quality research contributions** worthy of publication at top-tier database conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE). This document summarizes these contributions and provides guidance on how to proceed.

**Why publish?**
- Document production experience (LookingGlass + Janus-Datalog)
- Establish technical thought leadership
- Influence next-generation database systems
- Challenge 40+ years of database orthodoxy
- Make theoretical contributions practical

**Bottom line:** You've done the hard work (building production systems). Writing the papers is comparatively easy.

## The Three Papers

### Paper 1: "When Greedy Beats Optimal" üèÜ

**Core Contribution:** Greedy join ordering without statistics outperforms cost-based optimization for pattern-based queries

**Key Results:**
- 13% better execution plans
- 1000√ó faster planning (15¬µs vs 15ms)
- Zero statistics overhead
- Production validation with billions of facts

**Why it matters:**
- Challenges 45 years of database optimization (Selinger 1979)
- Shows simple algorithms can beat complex ones
- Applicable to graph DBs, time-series, embedded systems

**Target venue:** SIGMOD/VLDB (top tier)

**Estimated impact:** HIGH - would change how people think about query optimization

**Effort to write:** MEDIUM
- Technical content exists (benchmarks, code)
- Needs formal characterization
- LookingGlass experience (may need to navigate IP)

---

### Paper 2: "Datalog AS Relational Algebra" üìö

**Core Contribution:** Production Datalog system using ONLY classical relational algebra operations (no semi-naive, no magic sets)

**Key Results:**
- 13-87% faster than specialized strategies
- 60-70% less memory
- 10√ó simpler implementation (3K LOC vs 35K)
- Pure relational algebra suffices

**Why it matters:**
- Closes 40-year theory-practice gap
- Shows theoretical equivalence is practically useful
- Simplifies Datalog implementation dramatically

**Target venue:** SIGMOD/VLDB or PODS

**Estimated impact:** HIGH - connects two research communities (Datalog + relational DBs)

**Effort to write:** MEDIUM
- Translation semantics are clear
- Implementation exists
- Need more formal proofs

---

### Paper 3: "Functional Streaming Relational Algebra" üîÑ

**Core Contribution:** Applying functional programming principles (immutability, lazy evaluation, composition) to query execution

**Key Results:**
- 2.3√ó faster (up to 4.3√ó for pipelines)
- 99% memory reduction (for high selectivity)
- 10√ó simpler than traditional Volcano
- Symmetric hash joins eliminate materialization

**Why it matters:**
- Modernizes 30-year-old Volcano model
- Bridges databases and functional programming
- Shows FP principles improve systems performance

**Target venue:** SIGMOD/VLDB or OOPSLA (if emphasizing FP)

**Estimated impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - appeals to both DB and FP communities

**Effort to write:** MEDIUM
- Technical content exists (streaming docs)
- Benchmarks demonstrate benefits
- Good "bridge" between communities

## Common Objections (And Responses)

### "I don't have time."

**Response:** You've already done the hard part (building the system). Writing is comparatively easy. Even 5 hours/week ‚Üí paper in 6 months.

### "I'm not an academic."

**Response:** Industry experience is VALUABLE. Production systems are more compelling than toy examples. Your credibility is higher, not lower.

### "Someone else will publish this."

**Response:** No one else has your combination of (1) implementation, (2) production experience, (3) performance data, (4) LookingGlass background. This is uniquely yours.

### "The code speaks for itself."

**Response:** Code without papers = undiscovered. Papers = influence. If you want to change database systems, papers reach more people than code.

### "I don't want to deal with reviewers."

**Response:** Fair concern. But (1) your results are strong, (2) production validation is compelling, (3) can address criticism in revision. And collaborators can handle reviewer response if you prefer.

### "I have $10M to manage."

**Response:** Also fair! But these papers could (1) increase your professional options, (2) lead to consulting/advisory roles, (3) provide fallback career insurance. And the work is done‚Äîjust needs documentation.

### A. Reaching Out to Potential Collaborator

```
Subject: Production Datalog system with surprising performance results

Hi [Professor],

I'm Wes Brown, Distinguished Engineer at CoreWeave. I recently built a
production Datalog system (Janus-Datalog) with some surprising results:

1. Greedy join ordering beats cost-based optimization (13% better plans,
   1000√ó faster planning)
2. Pure relational algebra outperforms semi-naive evaluation for
   non-recursive queries
3. Functional programming techniques (immutability, lazy evaluation)
   improve query execution 2-4√ó

I have:
- Working implementation (open source)
- Production deployments (billions of facts)
- Performance benchmarks
- Prior patent on related work (US10614131B2)

Would you be interested in collaborating on a paper for SIGMOD/VLDB?
I can provide the system/data, and I'm looking for someone with academic
writing experience.

Background: [link to GitHub], [link to LinkedIn]

Best,
Wes Brown

## Final Thought

You built something genuinely novel. Don't let it be rediscovered by someone else in 5 years. Document it now, influence the field, and reap the benefits.

**The code is done. The papers are just writing down what you already know.** üìù‚ú®
